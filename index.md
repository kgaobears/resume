## Projects

Yelp Review Predictor | Python | Tensorflow	

- Developed neural nets to detect sentiment in Yelp reviews, taking as input common text and outputting a discrete rating one to five
- Implemented an ensemble of modified RNN's and transformer networks with an 86% validation accuracy

Procedural Map Generation | Java	

- Created an algorithm to procedurally generate realistic terrain by running Google Earth images through a neural net to get realistic transitions and mapping the output of the algorithm back to specific terrain from Google Earth
- Preprocessed satellite images to create a training data set of 500,000 3d voxels
- Ran a modified version of the DeepDream neural net to generate terrain based off initial flat plane jittered with Perlin noise

Habitica | Javascript | React Native | Swift | Open Source | Mobile/Web Developer

- Designed and implemented a notification system for a habit tracker app using React Native and native api
- Developed the project's first IoT extension into the Apple Watch, allowing the app to be more accessible

Bear Maps | School Project | Java | Algorithms

- Implemented A* path searching algorithm to find the optimal path to certain restaurants based on current traffic conditions
- Modified algorithm to take into account 1) slope grade and effect on gas mileage and 2) pedestrian levels' effect on road safety
